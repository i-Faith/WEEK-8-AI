# ðŸ©º AI-Powered Health Monitoring System

An AI-based application that monitors user health in real-time using vital sign data from wearables or manual inputs. 
The system uses machine learning to detect anomalies, predict risk levels, and provide personalized health recommendations via a web interface.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project is designed to:
- Predict health risk levels based on vital signs (heart rate, temperature, SpO2, etc.)
- Provide real-time alerts and recommendations
- Enable early detection of potential health issues
- Offer a user-friendly dashboard built with Streamlit

## ðŸ“Š Key Features

- Real-time health monitoring
- Machine learning-based risk prediction
- Simple web-based interface
- Alert system for anomalies
- Scalable for integration with wearable devices

## ðŸ§  Tech Stack

- Python
- Scikit-learn / TensorFlow (for ML model)
- Streamlit(for web app)
- Pandas & NumPy (data processing)
- Pickle (model deployment)

## How to run the app
- (in git bash)
- Go to the repository where the APP.py is stored
- Run the command :
streamlit run app.py
